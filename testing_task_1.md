### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame

  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  # The ace should not be capitalized 
  # There should be two equal signs instead of 1

  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end

# It should say def not dif 
# There should be a comma between the two arguments in the parenthesis
# There is one too many 'end' and there is also the incorrect indentation
# It should say 'return card1' instead of just 'card'

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end

# There should not be a . on the first line
# the total should say 'total = 0'
# There should be string interpolation on the return line - should say 'return "You have a total of #{total}"'

```
